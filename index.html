                            Busey ipsum dolor sit amet. Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remember to balance your internal energy with the environment.It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that you're proud of these ribs.It's good to yell at people and tell people that you're from Tennesee, so that way you'll be safe. 

                            I would like to give you a backstage pass to my imagination.When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant.You gotta go through it to see there ain't nothing to it.Did you feel that? Look at me - I'm not out of breath anymore! 
                            
                            Have you urinated? Have you drained your bladder? Are you free? Because if you haven't it will only come out later. I'm giving you some information that your bodily fluids may penetrate your clothing fibre's without warning.When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant. 
                            
                            Sometimes horses cough and fart at the same time, so stay out of the range of its butt muscle because a horses butt muscle is thick.The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing. 
                            
                            Listen to the silence. And when the silence is deafening, you're in the center of your own universe.When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant.These kind of things only happen for the first time once.
